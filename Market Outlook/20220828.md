## PCE - Personal Consumption Expenditure

- Food and energy can easily go down and up right away because they are so flexible
- Decimals dont tell all the story, where to get the right amounts?
- Annualize the 1 month amounts
- Market based PCE excluding Food/Energy
  - Some of the prices in the PCE are inputed prices, meaning there is no market price for it, it is just inputed.
  - So the market based PCE is using prices you can see in the market
  - Its biggest contributor is Owners equivalent rent
- Idexes
  - Mayority of expenditures are on services
- Relation PCE and CPI
  - 2 different ways to look at what happened in pricing
    - CPI: Genneral price level
    - PCE: Cost of living, because it measures what people actualy buy
  - PCE usually comes below CPI
  - They dont contradict each other
  - They may vary usually on flexible components
